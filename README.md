# LMP-Forecasting
Forecasting PJM Locational Marginal Prices with Neural Networks

A more in depth explanation of the code is in the Jupyter Notebook file. 

This LMP-Forecasting repository includes:

 - One Jupyter Notebook - 'LMP Forecasting.ipynb' - I would advise downloading this and using Jupyter Notebook instead of reading it within GitHub. The code got scrunched and hard to read. 
 - One PowerPoint presentation - 'LMP Research Project - Jack Morris.pptx'
 - Nine .csv files with the feature information
    - 'PJM_LMP_loss_cong.csv'
    - 'PJM_LMP_loss_cong_1hrback.csv'
    - 'PJM_LMP_loss_cong_2hrback.csv'
    - 'PJM_LMP_loss_cong_1dayback.csv'
    - 'PJM_LMP_loss_cong_2dayback.csv'
    - 'PJM_hours_years.csv'
    - 'PJM_weekdays_season.csv'
    - 'PJM-Gen-Mix-2007-2018.csv'
    - 'PJM_Reserve_Rates_2007_2018.csv'
    
The Jupyter Notebook is designed to explain each segment of the code and to demonstrate its predictive capability. For more serious use, it is advised that you adapt the notebook to a script. I included more code at the bottom of the notebook that I designed for Anaconda Prompt use which may be helpful. The presentation explains the concepts and details my analysis of the current model. 

Happy Forecasting
